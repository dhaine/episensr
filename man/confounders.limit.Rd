\title{Bounding the bias limits of unmeasured confounding.}
\usage{
confounders.limit(p = NA, RR = NA, OR = NA, crude.RR = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Proportion with the confounder among the unexposed group.}

\item{RR}{Relative risk between the confounder and the outcome.}

\item{OR}{Odds ratio between the confounder and the outcome.}

\item{crude.RR}{Crude relative risk between the exposure and the outcome.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\item{model}{Bias analysis performed.}
\item{bias.parms}{Input bias parameters.}
\item{adj.measures}{Output results.}
}
\description{
Function to elicit the limits on measures of effect corrected for an unmeasured
confounder when only some of the bias parameters are known. Crude relative
risk between exposure and outcome has minimally to be provided. Up to 3 other
parameters can be entered.
}
\examples{
confounders.limit(OR = 1.65, crude.RR = 1.5)
