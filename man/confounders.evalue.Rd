\title{Compute E-value to assess bias due to unmeasured confounder.}
\usage{
confounders.evalue(
  est,
  lower_ci = NULL,
  upper_ci = NULL,
  sd = NA,
  type = c("RR", "ORc", "HRc", "diff_RR", "diff_OR"),
  true_est = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{est}{Point estimate for the effect measure. For difference in continuous outcomes,
it is the standardized effect size (i.e. mean of the outcome divided by its standard
deviation).}

\item{lower_ci}{Lower limit of the confidence interval for the association (relative
risk, odds ratio, hazard ratio, incidence rate ratio, risk difference).}

\item{upper_ci}{Upper limit of the confidence interval for the association (relative
risk, odds ratio, hazard ratio, incidence rate ratio, risk difference).}

\item{sd}{For difference in continuous outcomes, the standard error of the outcome
divided by its standard deviation.}

\item{type}{Choice of effect measure (relative risk, and odds ratio or hazard ratio
for rare outcomes i.e. < 15% at end of follow-up -- RR; odds ratio for common
outcome -- ORc; hazard ratio for common outcome i.e. > 15% at end of follow-up -- HRc;
difference in continuous outcomes, RR approximation -- diff_RR; difference in
continuous outcomes, OR approximation -- diff_OR).}

\item{true_est}{True estimate to assess E-value for. Default to 1 on risk scale
to assess against null value. Set to a different value to assess for non-null
hypotheses.}
}
\value{
A matrix with the observed point estimate and closest confidence interval to
the null hypothesis, expressed as a relative risk, and their corresponding E-value.
}
\description{
Help to quantify the evidence strength for causality in presence of unmeasured
confounding. The E-value is the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured
confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, conditional
on the measured covariates, to fully explain away a specific exposure-outcome
association.
